This repository contains the code and analysis for the Survival Analysis Homework Assignment. 
The goal of this project is to build and compare different parametric models to understand the factors affecting subscriber churn and calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for different customer segments.

## Models

- Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models with all available distributions are built using Python and R.
- The models are compared based on their performance, and significant features are retained.
- Final model selection is discussed in the context of application for decision-making.

## Analysis

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is calculated per customer based on the final model.
- CLV is analyzed across different segments to identify the most valuable segments.
- A brief report included in the repository discusses the findings, interprets the model coefficients, and provides insights into the factors that affect churn risk.

## Installation

To run this project, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
